          <h4>Ideas</h4>
          <p>Creativity is the act of turning new and imaginative ideas into reality. Creativity is characterised by the ability to perceive the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, to make connections between seemingly unrelated phenomena, and to generate solutions</p>

          <p>it is said that there's no feeling which cannot be expressed through a portray. Paintings have been used for thousands of years to precise various human feelings.

          <p> All that you just require to place into a colourful image is your creativeness.</p>
