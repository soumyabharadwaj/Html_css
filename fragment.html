            The W3C JavaScript course has been set up to help Web developers have an understanding
            on basic concepts of the language. JavaScript is one of the three major Web developer tools,
            along with HTML5 and CSS3.The main objective of this course is to master good JavaScript
            practices and to avoid the pitfalls of the language. Weâ€™ll use JavaScript within the Web browser
  and take a look at its DOM API based on a few examples. Finally, we will study JQuery, which is
  one of the most used JavaScript libraries. You will be able to optimize your use of JQuery
  and develop interesting JQuery plugins.
